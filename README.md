## Sour Grapes

On 23 May 2020, during a Covid lockdown, I hosted a Zoom-powered murder mystery party for some friends. This was the website we used to coordinate our efforts. It backed onto Firebase for the live/interactive parts, but no longer does, but the public-facing page is still viable.

Stored here for archiving purposes. Probably no use or interest to anybody.
