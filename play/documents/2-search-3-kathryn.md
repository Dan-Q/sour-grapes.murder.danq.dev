## The Scenario:

A quarter of an hour has passed. You hastily gulped down a glass of the Killingsworth Farm wine, but a somber mood still lingers in the air. Where is Elizabeth Killingsworth? You feel ill at ease with this strange group of uninvited guests. One of the other guests - you do not notice who - suggests the group split up to find Elizabeth.

You wonder about the people around you and the circumstances that brought each person to Killingsworth Farm today. As the group begins to spread in different directions in search of Elizabeth, you decide to use this opportunity to find out more about the others.

## Your General Whereabouts (refer to this information throughout the game):

8:00 - 9:00 AM: At the Library shelving books and watering plants  
9:00 - 11:00 AM: Running errands in town  
11:00 AM - Noon: Morning coffee with Elizabeth Killingsworth at her Farm  
Noon - 12: 15 PM: Michael Nightshade arrives and speaks with Elizabeth  
12:15 - 1:30 PM: Making Lunch at Killingsworth Farm  
1:30 - 2:30 PM: Eating Lunch with Elizabeth, Vicki D'Adly, and Dr. Barren  
2:30 - 7:00 PM: Sitting on Farmhouse porch reading and waiting for Elizabeth  
7:00 PM - Present: Return to the Killingsworth farmhouse

## What You Know (reveal these facts during this round):

- You recognize Dr. Chelsea Barren from her book cover. Her last novel was nearly a best seller but was surrounded in controversy. You recall hearing that she was sued over it. You wonder if she is still writing. You went into the town library early this morning to shelve books and water the plants. As you were leaving, you noticed Norman in the gift shop next door. The cashier placed a few items into Norman's bag. You are certain that one of them was made of gold.
- At moming coffee with Elizabeth, she showed you a corkscrew that Nonnan had given to her just half an hour earlier. Elizabeth seemed very flustered by the gift. She did not seem to realize that it was still in her hands when the doorbell rang at noon.
- You recall that Enrique Graves seemed to have a lot more disposable income after Robert Killingsworth's death, spending more time on his car and friends and less time at the library.

## Your Secrets (reveal these facts only when challenged):

- At noon, Michael Nightshade arrived to consider buying the Killingsworth Farm. You were not feeling well at the time, so while Elizabeth spoke to Michael Nightshade on the porch, you went to the bathroom to look for some antacid.
- Michael Nightshade has been in the library often this week. You've pulled some research materials for him regarding the town history; you don't recall exactly what, it didn't seem important at the time.
