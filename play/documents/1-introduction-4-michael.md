## The Scenario:

The sun is setting beyond the rolling hills of California's lush wine country, and you find yourself standing in the front hall of the main house on Killingsworth Farms.

You arrived earlier today to see Elizabeth Killingsworth, a recent widow who, due to hard times, is looking to sell the farm that she and her husband purchased just over a year ago.

Five others have joined you in the hall. Elizabeth, however, is not present. The strangers around you are looking at you with interest. You help yourself to a glass of wine from the hall table and introduce yourself.

## Who You Are (use this information to introduce yourself):

You have come from New York to California on business. Business is your life and your cellular telephone is almost a permanent fixture in your hand. As a land development consultant, you've been hired by the state of California to find an inexpensive tract of land to develop into a low-cost housing project.

When you are not working (a rare occurrence) you enjoy hitting the clubs. You are young and energetic and quite charismatic. The ladies tend to fawn over you, but you suspect that is mostly because of the 2.6 million dollars you made last year in land development. If you can pull off this job for the state of California, you may even become a partner in your firm. Unfortunately, the state has given you a minuscule budget with which to acquire and develop the land. It was almost a dream-come-true to find the Killingsworth Farm available under the current market value. Elizabeth's misfortune is your good fortune. You hope that she will see that your mission was for a good cause and give you an even better deal.

You arrived today without an appointment. You saw the real estate listing in the newspaper and rushed right over...

You have spent much of the day surveying the Killingsworth Fann and have sketched out a map of the area (*Exhibit A*). Show it to the others (optionally while discussing how much better-suited this land, with its lakeside view, would be for housing than for farmland).

## Your Darker Side (keep this information secret):

You are not a hotshot land developer. You are a junior executive trainee at a real estate brokerage firm in New York City. You do not have millions of dollars, but you are charismatic and can easily convince others that you are made of money, and that helps you get your way.

You have never been to California before which is exactly why your Aunt Kathryn Lawless insisted you come. You know that she is crazy, and she wouldn't give you exact details, but she told you that there would be a lot of money in it for you if you could get Elizabeth Killingsworth to sell the farm to you - and you sell it in turn to her. Kathryn insisted, however, that you keep her identity and your relationship to her a secret. But why?
