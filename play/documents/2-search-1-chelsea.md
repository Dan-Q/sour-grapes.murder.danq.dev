## The Scenario:

A quarter of an hour has passed. You hastily gulped down a glass of the Killingsworth Farm wine, but a somber mood still lingers in the air. Where is Elizabeth Killingsworth? You feel ill at ease with this strange group of uninvited guests. One of the other guests - you do not notice who - suggests the group split up to find Elizabeth.

You wonder about the people around you and the circumstances that brought each person to Killingsworth Farm today. As the group begins to spread in different directions in search of Elizabeth, you decide to use this opportunity to find out more about the others.

## What You Know (reveal these facts during this round):

- While tending your garden around Noon, you noticed Michael Nightshade drive up to Killingsworth Farm. Being curious, you watched as he went to the door and talked with Elizabeth Killingsworth on the front porch. Though an open window of the farmhouse, you saw Kathryn Lawless rooting through a medicine cabinet in the bathroom. She took something that looked like a small pill bottle and put it into her pocket. By 12:15, she joined Elizabeth and Michael on the front porch.
- You have spent much of the week in the library doing research. You have seen Enrique Graves there a number of times, but never studying. He always comes in, takes papers from the librarian (never any books, though) and leaves. You've also noticed Michael Nightshade's car in the parking lot of the library every day for the last four days.

## Your Secrets (reveal these facts only when challenged):

- When a certain Hollywood star thought your last novel was about him, he sued you for millions. You have been low on cash since, but now you have a new novel coming out based on Robert Killingsworth's murder. Things are finally starting have to look up for you financially.
- You have virtually no cash left. If your book deal falls through. you will have nothing left but your little tract of land next to Killingsworth Farms. And if Michael Nightshade turns Killingsworth Farm into low-cost housing, you suspect your property value will diminish considerably.
- You have always suspected that Elizabeth Killingsworth killed her husband Robert to collect the life insurance money and escape the failing farm: in fact, this is the plot to your next novel.
