## The Scenario:

The group returned to the Wine Vaults with flashlights. In the light, you could see the many meandering paths formed by the stacked oak barrels of wine and almost got lost. Coming upon the body, you confirmed that it is, in fact, Elizabeth Killingsworth, and you immediately saw the cause of her death. A golden corkscrew juts from the right side of her neck. There appeared to be something inscribed on the corkscrew, but the pool of blood prevented you from getting close enough to the body for a closer inspection and nobody dared to implicate themselves by interfering with the scene before the police arrive.

The sight of Elizabeth's body is too gruesome for some of the guests and you decided to return, once again, to the main house to ponder these new clues.

## What You Know (reveal these facts during this round):

- You last saw Elizabeth Killingsworth alive during lunchtime. You spent much of the day by yourself, but you did meet with Norman for a short while in your bedroom at 2:00 PM.
- You sat with Kathryn Lawless on the back porch for a short time and the discussion turned toward life-goals. You told Kathryn that you would like to go to Hollywood and become a star... if only you were not burdened with a husband and three kids. Kathryn seemed to lose herself, and she told you of her similar dream of getting out of this small town to live an exciting life: and that she was going to do something about it. She did not elaborate, though. She only grinned and laughed - almost maniacally.

## Your Secrets (reveal these facts only when challenged):

- At 5:30 PM, you found yourself by the Fountain in the Rose Garden. Enrique Graves was there and you began talking and flirting. Soon the situation became passionate and you started kissing. You left soon afterward, however, deciding to meet up with Enrique later that evening after Norman fell asleep. By 6:00 PM, you had left the Rose Garden to change clothes.
- At about 6:45 PM, you decided to go find Enrique again. You did not see him outside, so decided to check the Wine Vaults. As you were making your way down the labyrinth of halls, you suddenly ran into Enrique. At the same time you saw him, however, you heard a loud popping sound. The lights flickered and went out. You panicked and screamed. You do not remember what happened after that until you found yourself back at the Farmhouse with the rest of the guests.
