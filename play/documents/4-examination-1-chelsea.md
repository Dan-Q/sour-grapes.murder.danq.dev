## The Scenario:

The group returned to the Wine Vaults with flashlights. In the light, you could see the many meandering paths formed by the stacked oak barrels of wine and almost got lost. Coming upon the body, you confirmed that it is, in fact, Elizabeth Killingsworth, and you immediately saw the cause of her death. A golden corkscrew juts from the right side of her neck. There appeared to be something inscribed on the corkscrew, but the pool of blood prevented you from getting close enough to the body for a closer inspection and nobody dared to implicate themselves by interfering with the scene before the police arrive.

The sight of Elizabeth's body is too gruesome for some of the guests and you decided to return, once again, to the main house to ponder these new clues.

## What You Know (reveal these facts during this round):

- You looked at the digital clock in the Wine Vaults. It reset to 00:00 and started blinked when the power went out: you do some arithmatic and determine that the power went out at exactly 6:45 PM. Where was everybody? Who was the last person to see Elizabeth Killingsworth alive? You last saw Elizabeth at 3:45 PM when you had a brief conversation with her in the farmhouse about your upcoming novel. You left Elizabeth and went home to call your publisher.
- At 5:30 PM, you were swimming in your pool when you saw Enrique Graves and Vicki D'Adly in the Rose Garden at Killingsworth Farm. By the time you got out of the pool to find out what was going on, Vicki had left.
- About 6:45 PM, you saw Vicki D'Adly heading toward the Wine Vault. You noticed that she was wearing a different outfit than she had been that aftemoon. You also noticed that Kathryn Lawless was sitting on the back porch of Killingsworth Farmhouse watching you. You followed Vicki into the Wine Vault, and trailed her as she made her way through the labyrinth of halls, never letting her out of your sight...

## Your Secrets (reveal these facts only when challenged):

- You loved Robert Killingsworth. You had an affair with him just prior to his death. Elizabeth suspected the affair and confronted Robert about it. Robert and Elizabeth decided to seek counselling in an effort to save their marriage. Robert broke off his affair with you immediately. He died only days later.
