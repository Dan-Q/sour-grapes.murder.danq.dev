## The Scenario:

Almost as soon as all of the guests split up in search of the missing Elizabeth Killingsworth, one of the guests' shouts draws everyone deep into the labyrinth that makes up the Killingsworth Wine Vault - an expansive wine storage facility behind the Killingsworth Farmhouse. The lights will not turn on and only a sliver of moonlight shines through the window. As your eyes adjust to the darkness, you see a body face down in a large pool of blood. Your intuition tells you that you have found the body of Elizabeth Killingsworth.

The darkness of the Wine Vault makes an examination of the body impossible. The group decides to return to the main house to call the police. You suspect someone in this group is responsible for the murder of Elizabeth Killingsworth, and you have a few questions to ask.

## What You Know (reveal these facts during this round):

- You knew Robert Killingsworth well. He was a strong and capable man. The fact that he was bludgeoned to death is unsettling. His killer must have surprised him - or tricked him. Who was the last person to see him alive?
- Around 1:00 PM, the Killingsworth telephone rang and you answered it. It was a law firm calling for Norman. He was on the phone in the study for the next hour and a half. You listened into the phone call and heard Norman talking to a lawyer about a sexual harassment lawsuit and something about embezzlement.
- At 1:30 PM, Dr. Chelsea Barren joined you, Vicki D'Adly, and Elizabeth for lunch at the Killingsworth Farmhouse. Though Elizabeth tried to change the subject many times, the conversation mainly revolved around Michael Nightshade wanting to turn the farm into a low cost housing development. Dr. Barren was very unhappy about the prospects.

## Your Secrets (reveal these facts only when challenged):

- You routinely do Enrique's homework for him. You were writing a research paper on the Gold Rush Era when you came across a letter written by Samuel Friedmont, buried in a slightly water-damaged box in the closed archives of the library. Samuel Friedmont was an early founder of Marcocain and a prospector in the area in the 19th century. He died shortly after the letter was written when he drowned in the lake on his property.
- Your infatuation with Enrique Graves goes almost to the point of stalking him. After performing a background check on him via the Internet, you discovered that he had been arrested for selling drugs to an under-cover police officer over a year ago. Apparently, he skipped town after serving a short jail sentence.
