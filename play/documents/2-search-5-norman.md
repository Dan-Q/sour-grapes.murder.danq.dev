## The Scenario:

A quarter of an hour has passed. You hastily gulped down a glass of the Killingsworth Farm wine, but a somber mood still lingers in the air. Where is Elizabeth Killingsworth? You feel ill at ease with this strange group of uninvited guests. One of the other guests - you do not notice who - suggests the group split up to find Elizabeth.

You wonder about the people around you and the circumstances that brought each person to Killingsworth Farm today. As the group begins to spread in different directions in search of Elizabeth, you decide to use this opportunity to find out more about the others.

## What You Know (reveal these fact during this round):

- You slept badly and woke early: your wife Vicki is afraid of the dark and insists on sleeping with a light on; you usually wear a sleep mask but you couldn't find it last night.
- While searching for the missing Elizabeth, you entered her bedroom and found a small shrine dedicated to her late husband Robert. One particular article caught your attention (*Exhibit B*): show it to the others.
- While bird watching around at 12:45 PM, you noticed Enrique Graves stalking around the farm grounds. He seemed to be secretly observing something. You did not want to pry, so you continued walking.
- You gave Michael Nightshade your resume and told him of your background in real estate. Michael told you that the company was not hiring as the market was down. That's odd: you'd heard the opposite - the housing market is really picking up fast right now.

## Your Secrets (reveal these facts only when challenged):

- You have been having a rough marital time with Vicki. You woke up early and went into town to buy her a silver charm bracelet to get back into her good graces.
- At 10:30 AM, you gave Elizabeth an engraved corkscrew as a gift for her hospitality to you and Vicki during your vacation.
