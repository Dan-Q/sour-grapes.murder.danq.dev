## The Scenario:

You can hear the wail of distant police sirens. Soon investigators will be swarming Killingsworth Farms and asking questions that you may not want to answer. You still have a few minutes, though, and there are a few issues with your fellow guests you want to clear up...

## What You Know (reveal these facts during this round):

- While in Elizabeth's study you noticed a candlestick on the fireplace mantle. Enrique Graves gave you an identical candlestick months ago as a birthday gift. Yours, however, is dented and not in as nice of condition.
- All clues will have been revealed by the end of Round Five. When you have figured out whodunit, how, and why, record your solution on the Accusation Form.
