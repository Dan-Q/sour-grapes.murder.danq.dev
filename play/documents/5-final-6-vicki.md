## The Scenario:

You can hear the wail of distant police sirens. Soon investigators will be swarming Killingsworth Farms and asking questions that you may not want to answer. You still have a few minutes, though, and there are a few issues with your fellow guests you want to clear up...

## What You Know (reveal these facts during this round):

- As the others filed out of the vaults, you crept back to Elizabeth's body to confirm for yourself that your sister really is dead. There, unwatched by the others, you got a closer look at the corkscrew. It is engraved: "To Elizabeth. I will always love you. Let's toast to a new life together."
- On the way out through the a joining hall you also noticed a bottle for prescription sleeping pills. The date on the bottle indicated that it was refilled only two days ago, but the bottle was empty.
- All clues will have been revealed by the end of Round Five. When you have figured out whodunit, how, and why, record your solution on the Accusation Form.
