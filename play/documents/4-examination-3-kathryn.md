## The Scenario:

The group returned to the Wine Vaults with flashlights. In the light, you could see the many meandering paths formed by the stacked oak barrels of wine and almost got lost. Coming upon the body, you confirmed that it is, in fact, Elizabeth Killingsworth, and you immediately saw the cause of her death. A golden corkscrew juts from the right side of her neck. There appeared to be something inscribed on the corkscrew, but the pool of blood prevented you from getting close enough to the body for a closer inspection and nobody dared to implicate themselves by interfering with the scene before the police arrive.

The sight of Elizabeth's body is too gruesome for some of the guests and you decided to return, once again, to the main house to ponder these new clues.

## What You Know (reveal these facts during this round):

- Beside Elizabeth's body you found a piece of paper: this is *Exhibit D*.
- You last saw Elizabeth Killingsworth alive during lunch. Around 4:00 PM, you quickly drove back to the library and checked out a copy of Dr. Chelsea Barren's last book. Soon afterwards, you were sitting on Killingsworth Farm's back porch reading the book and waiting for Elizabeth to finish showing Michael Nightshade around the farm. She never returned.
- At around 6:45 PM, you noticed Dr. Chelsea Barren come from her house next door. She followed someone into the Wine Vaults. Moments later, the lights in the window of the Wine Vaults flickered and went out.

## Your Secrets (reveal these facts only when challenged):

- You have always dreamed of becoming a star in Hollywood or on the Broadway stage. Today, inspired by a self-help book you recently read which encouraged more-actively committing to your goals, you quit your job at the library.
