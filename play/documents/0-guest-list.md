## Invitation

_One year ago, Robert Killingsworth bought the farm. Six months later, he was dead - leaving his
widow Elizabeth to tend their fledgling vineyard and winery on the outskirts of California's wine
country. With mounting debts and no idea how to run a business, Elizabeth is desperate to sell
the farm and recoup her losses. This spring's fierce drought and the shaky economy, however, have
left Killingsworth Farm on the market for far too long._

On 23 May 1996, six people passed through the gates of Killingsworth Farm to see Elizabeth.

One of them is a cold-blooded killer.
