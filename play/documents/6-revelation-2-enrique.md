## The Scenario:

The police have arrived. You know that your secrets will soon be exposed so you decide to make a statement:

## Your Statement:

Read the following statement:

_I never liked Robert Killingsworth, Elizabeth's husband, and he never liked me. He was jealous of my relationship with Elizabeth. Even though our relationship was never physical, she adored me. Robert did not trust me... for good reason. I did not drop out of college a year ago. I was kicked out for drug possession and for attempting to sell marijuana to an undercover police officer. This was an offense for which I was arrested._

_After serving a short jail sentence, I headed West to California. I really was doing well for myself here. Elizabeth had me enrolled in college and I had that librarian, Kathryn Lawless, so wrapped around my little finger that she was doing all the work for me. Robert Killingsworth, however, had tried to ruin everything for me. He did some investigation into my past and discovered my arrest. As fate would have it, Robert decided to confront me just as I was searching through his bank files in his study for a way to get at the Killingsworth money. Robert was enraged and tried to call the police. I could not let that happen. As soon as he turned around to pick up the phone, I grabbed a candlestick from the fireplace mantle and hit him over the head._

_I dumped Robert's lifeless body into Friedmont Mill Lake, but I should have weighted it down. Robert's body surfaced two weeks later. I cleaned the murder weapon and disposed of it by giving it to Kathryn Lawless as a birthday present. If Elizabeth ever found out that I killed her husband, I would have had to kill her too._

_Vicki D'Adly and I were in the Rose Garden fooling around tonight around 5:30 PM. Either one of us could have found the corkscrew. There is only my word, however, that I did not find it. Besides, I was unconscious at the time that Elizabeth was killed. I had been working on the wiring short in the Wine Vault when I was nearly electrocuted and blacked-out. Vicki can attest to that. There is no way I could have killed Elizabeth Killingsworth.
