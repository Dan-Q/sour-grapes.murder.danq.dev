## The Scenario:

Almost as soon as all of the guests split up in search of the missing Elizabeth Killingsworth, one of the guests' shouts draws everyone deep into the labyrinth that makes up the Killingsworth Wine Vault - an expansive wine storage facility behind the Killingsworth Farmhouse. The lights will not turn on and only a sliver of moonlight shines through the window. As your eyes adjust to the darkness, you see a body face down in a large pool of blood. Your intuition tells you that you have found the body of Elizabeth Killingsworth.

The darkness of the Wine Vault makes an examination of the body impossible. The group decides to return to the main house to call the police. You suspect someone in this group is responsible for the murder of Elizabeth Killingsworth, and you have a few questions to ask.

## What You Know (reveal these facts during this round):

- When Norman and Vicki D'Adly arrived last night, you helped them with some luggage from their RV. You noticed the RV was filled with boxes - much more than two people would ever need on vacation.
- At about 3:00 PM, you were fixing the wiring in the Wine Vaults when Dr. Chelsea Barren joined you. You have been sleeping around with Dr. Barren, but you know that she is just using you to get information about the Killingsworths for her next book.
- You've found an old letter (*Exhibit C*) which seems to indicate that the value of the land under Friedmont Farm - the original farm whose subdivision created Killingsworth Farm and several smaller plots - might be more-valuable than it appears.

## Your Secrets (reveal these facts only when challenged):

- You have lost a page of pin-codes and bank information. You suspect Dr. Barren took it from you this afternoon. You had not realized that she was that hard up for money.
- You have a special friendship with Kathryn Lawless. She writes your college papers for you in return for spending evenings with her. As librarian, she has access to valuable historical reference materials - some of which you stole in hopes of selling for extra cash. That's how you came across the old letter.
