## The Scenario:

The police have arrived. You know that your secrets will soon be exposed so you decide to make a statement:

## Your Statement:

Read the following statement:

_Well, I was certainly fooled by Michael Nightshade's deception. I was terrified that he was going to turn the Killingsworth Farm into low-cost housing. I have already lost my practice and book deals. If Elizabeth sold her farm, my property value would have plummeted. I would have had nothing left. I would be completely broke._

_But I would not have killed Elizabeth over a few dollars. I am a doctor, after all. On the other hand, I had always suspected that Elizabeth Killingsworth murdered her husband, Robert, six months ago. I loved Robert and had been having an affair with him. When his death went unsolved, I made it my mission to expose Elizabeth as his killer and make the story my next best-selling book. I had assumed that Elizabeth had killed Robert for his life insurance, but I was surprised to see her even worse-off financially after his death._

_I have been sleeping with Enrique Graves, the farmhand, in order to gain inside infonnation into Elizabeth's life. Today, I struck gold! I found a clue to Robert's killer. I found a list of bank records, pin codes, and financial transactions from immediately after Robert's death. I was shocked to learn that it was not Elizabeth who killed Robert. I came to her with this evidence, but she would not accept it. Anyway, you can read in my next book who killed Robert Killingsworth. As for Elizabeth, however, I am baffied..._
