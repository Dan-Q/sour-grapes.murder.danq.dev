## The Scenario:

You can hear the wail of distant police sirens. Soon investigators will be swarming Killingsworth Farms and asking questions that you may not want to answer. You still have a few minutes, though, and there are a few issues with your fellow guests you want to clear up...

## What You Know (reveal these facts during this round):

- Enrique Graves seems desperate to retrieve the piece of paper that fell out of his wallet during your 3:00 PM tryst. You wonder if the paper has something to do with Robert's death. You showed the paper to Elizabeth Killingsworth at 3:45 PM. If you haven't shown *Exhibit E* to the others yet, share it now.
- All clues will have been revealed by the end of Round Five. When you have figured out whodunit, how, and why, record your solution on the Accusation Form.
