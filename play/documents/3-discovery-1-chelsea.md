## The Scenario:

Almost as soon as all of the guests split up in search of the missing Elizabeth Killingsworth, one of the guests' shouts draws everyone deep into the labyrinth that makes up the Killingsworth Wine Vault - an expansive wine storage facility behind the Killingsworth Farmhouse. The lights will not turn on and only a sliver of moonlight shines through the window. As your eyes adjust to the darkness, you see a body face down in a large pool of blood. Your intuition tells you that you have found the body of Elizabeth Killingsworth.

The darkness of the Wine Vault makes an examination of the body impossible. The group decides to return to the main house to call the police. You suspect someone in this group is responsible for the murder of Elizabeth Killingsworth, and you have a few questions to ask.

## What You Know (reveal these facts daring this round):

- You joined (invited yourself) in for lunch with Elizabeth at 1:30 PM. Kathryn Lawless and Vicki D'Adly were there as well.
- You have known for a long time now that Enrique Graves grows his own marijuana crop down by the lake. You wonder if he has a drug problem or if anybody else knows about it.
- Elizabeth Killingsworth initially offered a large cash reward for information leading to the arrest of her husband's killer, but retracted the offer days later.

## Your Secrets (reveal these facts only when challenged):

- Six months ago, you were the last person to see Robert Killingsworth alive. You met Robert for lunch at Killingsworth Farm as you often did. After lunch, you left him in order to keep an appointment with your book publisher. Robert was very much alive at the time when you left.
- You are sleeping with Enrique Graves. After your usual 3:00 PM tryst in the Wine Vaults, you noticed a piece of paper had fallen out of his pocket. You picked it up to look at it and headed straight to the Farmhouse to find Elizabeth Killingsworth. This is *Exhibit E*, but you don't have to share it with the others unless you're specifically asked about it (or you want to). You wonder if it has something to do with Robert's death.
