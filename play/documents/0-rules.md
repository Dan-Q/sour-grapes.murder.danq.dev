## How To Play

### Get connected

* Test out all of the technology you'll depend on beforehand: does the video work? Can you hear others and be heard? Do the devices you intend to use show these pages okay?
* If possible, come dressed as your character: see the Preamble for suggestions. Playing online means that you only strictly need to dress for the parts of you that can be seen!
* The characters are somewhat loosely-defined and you're free (and encouraged) to roleplay a little. Think about how they'll act and feel about the things going on around them. You can even invent your own bits of backstory (so long as they don't conflict with anything you read in the script!). This can be used to help make small-talk, which can help everybody else get into character too.

### Using this application

* Documents will become available to you over the course of the event. Keep an eye on your document list for new arrivals (your host should hint to you when they appear, though)!
* Click or tap on a document to open it. You can close a document by clicking/tapping the 'close' button in the corner, or by pressing the 'Escape' key on your keyboard.
* If you lose your connection, just come back to this web address and you'll carry on from where you left off. You might like to bookmark the web address you're at now!
* If the host's telling you about a new document that you should be able to see but it doesn't appear for more than 15 seconds, try refreshing the page.

### Playing the game

* In each chapter, you'll be given an update to the story (from your perspective). Read this to yourself.
* You'll usually also be given a list of things that you _must_ bring up in that chapter. You can address them all at once, or one at a time. You can address them in any order. You can wait until they fit into the conversation, or you can interject and bring them to the forefront. It's up to you how you bring each topic to the conversation, but you _must_ bring all of them.
* You'll usually also be given a list of things that you _don't_ have to bring up. These are your _secrets_. If you're questioned directly about the topics they cover then you have to answer truthfully, but you don't have to volunteer information from this list unless you want to.
* Sometimes you might be given an Exhibit among your documents. These are clues which you'll present to the other players at a time of your choosing during the chapter. The document will automatically appear in the other players' document lists when the host hears you start to talk about it: make it clear what you're referring to, e.g. by saying "I found this copy of the deceased's will while I was exploring his office", so that the host knows that the document is ready to be shared. In this game, you cannot _selectively_ share (i.e. with only _some_ of the other players).
* You can revisit old documents at any time. (You're likely to need to do this in order to check on e.g. bits of your alibi that you'll have established early on!)
* You might like to take your own notes as you go along.
* When playing via video chat, make sure you leave space to hear from every other player in each chapter. If need be, you're encouraged to ask direct questions of quieter players in order to help include them in the conversation: video chat "feels" very different to in-person group conversations!
* Unlike most of Dan's murder mysteries, the murderer _does not know_ that they committed the crime until the very end; they'll be given lies to tell in order to establish their alibi. If you suspect that you might be the murderer, make sure your alibi is defensible or try to redirect attention onto somebody else! (Also: when asked to guess who the murderer was, you can guess yourself.)

### Rules

* A chapter cannot advance until every player has brought up every topic they're required to, and shared any Exhibits they've been given in that chapter.
* Players should be given the opportunity to question suspects based on the clues learned in each round.
* Players cannot lie, but they can be evasive in response to interrogation. However, be wary of neglecting to mention a detail upon which your defence may depend later on!
* Stay in character!
