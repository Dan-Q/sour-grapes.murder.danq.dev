## The Scenario:

The group returned to the Wine Vaults with flashlights. In the light, you could see the many meandering paths formed by the stacked oak barrels of wine and almost got lost. Coming upon the body, you confirmed that it is, in fact, Elizabeth Killingsworth, and you immediately saw the cause of her death. A golden corkscrew juts from the right side of her neck. There appeared to be something inscribed on the corkscrew, but the pool of blood prevented you from getting close enough to the body for a closer inspection and nobody dared to implicate themselves by interfering with the scene before the police arrive.

The sight of Elizabeth's body is too gruesome for some of the guests and you decided to return, once again, to the main house to ponder these new clues.

## What You Know (reveal these facts during this round):

- You last saw Elizabeth Killingsworth alive around 5:30 PM while you were taking a break. Elizabeth was heading into the Wine Vaults with Michael Nightshade.
- At 6:30 PM, you went to the Wine Vault to work on a short in the wiring. You were sure that you turned off the electricity, but at about 6:45 PM you were shocked by a jolt of electricity that knocked you unconscious for the next quarter of an hour. The jolt of electricity must have knocked out the lights in the Wine Vault.
- Dr. Chelsea Barren was almost as devastated by Robert KillingsWorth's death as Elizabeth. You've always wondered why. Her ongoing interest in his death seems too extreme to be strictly professional.

## Your Secrets (reveal these facts only when challenged):

- At 5:30 PM, you were cleaning the fountain in the Rose Garden when Vicki approached you. You talked for a while. The two of you began to flirt and were soon kissing passionately.
