## The Scenario:

The sun is setting beyond the rolling hills of California's lush wine country, and you find yourself standing in the front hall of the main house on Killingsworth Farms.

You arrived earlier today to see Elizabeth Killingsworth, a recent widow who, due to hard times, is looking to sell the farm that she and her husband purchased just over a year ago.

Five others have joined you in the hall. Elizabeth, however, is not present. The strangers around you are looking at you with interest. You help yourself to a glass of wine from the hall table and introduce yourself.

## Who You Are (use this information to introduce yourself):

You are the (one year) younger sister of Elizabeth. As a child, you adored your older sister and were the best of friends. As she grew older, however, and discovered boys, the two of you drifted apart from each other. When Elizabeth married Robert Killingsworth and moved to California, you lost touch completely. After graduating high school, you married your high school sweetheart, Norman, and remained in your hometown of Jersey City, New Jersey. Currently you are a part time homemaker taking care of your three boys and also work part time at the make-up counter of the department store in the mall. You are hopelessly addicted to daytime soap operas and talk shows. Your claim to fame is that you once appeared on the Jerry Springer Show: the episode titled "What I'd Do For a Buck" is still the talk of the beauty shop.

You and Norman have been traveling around the country in your new RV. Yesterday, you arrived at Killingsworth Farms. You were hoping to take this opportunity to build a better relationship with your sister.

## Your Darker Side (keep this information secret):

Elizabeth has not spoken to you in years - ever since you stole her high school boyfriend, Norman. You hated the fact that she was in love with Norman and stopped spending time with you. Not only did Elizabeth despise you for stealing Norman from her, but your parents resented it as well. At age 18 you secretly eloped with Norman and have lived with him ever since.

You do not love Norman, but with three kids and no college education, you feel trapped with him. Norman, unfortunately, is an insecure loser. He has a gambling problem, and owes money to some very powerful people. You have a plan to get out of this terrible situation, though. You have decided to drop by on Elizabeth and tell her that Norman is abusive to you in hopes of getting a loan, dumping dumb Norman, and moving out on your own. Perhaps you could even come and live in California and become a soap opera actress... no... a soap opera diva!
