## The Scenario:

You can hear the wail of distant police sirens. Soon investigators will be swarming Killingsworth Farms and asking questions that you may not want to answer. You still have a few minutes, though, and there are a few issues with your fellow guests you want to clear up...

## What You Know (reveal these facts during this round):

- Earlier in the day, you bumped into Vicki D'Adly and, thinking it was Elizabeth, began asking her questions about the extent of the farmlands. Vicki interntpted you to tell you that she was not Elizabeth: the two sisters look nearly identical.
- All clues will have been revealed by the end of Round Five. When you have figured out whodunit, how, and why, record your solution on the Accusation Form.
