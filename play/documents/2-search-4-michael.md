## The Scenario:

A quarter of an hour has passed. You hastily gulped down a glass of the Killingsworth Farm wine, but a somber mood still lingers in the air. Where is Elizabeth Killingsworth? You feel ill at ease with this strange group of uninvited guests. One of the other guests - you do not notice who - suggests the group split up to find Elizabeth.

You wonder about the people around you and the circumstances that brought each person to Killingsworth Farm today. As the group begins to spread in different directions in search of Elizabeth, you decide to use this opportunity to find out more about the others.

## What You Know (reveal these facts during this round):

- You arrived at Killingsworth Farm at noon. You approached the house to ask Elizabeth Killingsworth if you could look around the grounds and she seemed very happy to oblige. In fact, she almost seemed desperate to show you around. Behind Elizabeth, you could see Kathryn Lawless who came out to join you on the front porch at about 12:15.
- While you and Elizabeth were walking around the grounds, you noticed that she was carrying around a small metal object barely-concealed in her left hand. You do not think she even realized that she was carrying it as she had been so engrossed in talking about the farm. At about 1:00 PM, you were in the Rose Garden when a bee stung Elizabeth. She dropped the object she was carrying in the grass and ran back inside the house. You followed her.

## Your Secrets (reveal these facts only when challenged):

- You have spent the last four days at the library researching all aspects of the town. You need to report back to your company to begin a marketing campaign for the new housing development.
- Norman D'Adly passed his resume to you this aftemoon. He seemed too desperate to gain employment, so you told him that your company was not hiring. You wonder about his current work situation.
