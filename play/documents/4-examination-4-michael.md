## The Scenario

The group returned to the Wine Vaults with flashlights. In the light, you could see the many meandering paths formed by the stacked oak barrels of wine and almost got lost. Coming upon the body, you confirmed that it is, in fact, Elizabeth Killingsworth, and you immediately saw the cause of her death. A golden corkscrew juts from the right side of her neck. There appeared to be something inscribed on the corkscrew, but the pool of blood prevented you from getting close enough to the body for a closer inspection and nobody dared to implicate themselves by interfering with the scene before the police arrive.

The sight of Elizabeth's body is too gruesome for some of the guests and you decided to return, once again, to the main house to ponder these new clues.

## What You Know (reveal these facts during this round)

- Elizabeth Killingsworth's handwriting (which you'll see on the note, *Exhibit D*) looks familiar. Where have you seen that handwriting before...?
- At 5:15 PM, you met with Elizabeth Killingsworth again. Together, you found a cozy corner in the Wine Vaults to sample various wines and discuss the sale of Killingsworth Farm. You were still drinking together when the lights flickered and went out. You heard someone screaming from the other end of the Wine Vaults. Elizabeth told you to wait there while she went and investigated. That was the last time you saw her alive.

## Your Secrets (reveal these facts only when challenged)

- You demanded that your Aunt Kathryn tell you why she wanted you to pretend to be a real estate developer to try and buy the Killingsworth Farm cheaply, or you would not go through with the ruse. Kathryn told you a story of gold buried on the land worth millions. Her plans to obtain the land seemed deranged, but she kept saying that she was desperate to leave this small town and promising you a nice profit from the deal.
- At 2:15 PM, Kathryn Lawless crept out to your car with a bottle of sleeping pills. She told you to crush them and keep them in your pocket. If Elizabeth Killingsworth refused to sell the farm to you, you were to slip them in her drink the first chance you could get.
