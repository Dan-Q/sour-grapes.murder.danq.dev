## The Scenario:

The police have arrived. You know that your secrets will soon be exposed so you decide to make a statement:

## Your Statement:

Read the following statement:

_My life has revolved around books. That is why I became a librarian. Some people, however, might call me a dreamer. I will admit that I have always longed for a more exciting life. Tonight has been especially exciting for me. For once, I do not have to be content just reading a mystery in  a novel: I can finally live the adventure._

_As a fan of mystery novels, I've leamed the crucial factors in solving any murder. The killer must have a motive to murder, the means to commit the crime, and the opportunity to do so. I was Elizabeth Killingsworth's best friend. I would never have dreamed of killing her. In fact, I could not have killed her. We know that Elizabeth was murdered in the Wine Vaults this evening. I was nowhere near the Wine Vaults today. Furthermore, Elizabeth was found with a corkscrew jutting out of her neck. Earlier today, Elizabeth told me that Norman D'Adly had given that same corkscrew to her as a gift. He had even inscribed it to her. Elizabeth mentioned that she dropped the corkscrew in the Rose Garden today after being stung by a bee. She rushed back to the Farmhouse for treatment. The time was 1:00 PM._

_Only the people who were in the Rose Garden today would have had access to the weapon used to kill Elizabeth. I am innocent._
